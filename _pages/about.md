Hello, üëãüèæ I'm a Master's student in Electrical Engineering at The George Washington University, where I'm working on techniques using convolutional neural networks to detect defects in photovoltaic modules. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, which ignited my passion for low-voltage electronics, DIY projects, and rapid prototyping. Meanwhile, my ongoing Master's studies fuel my fascination with high-voltage power generation, distribution, and cutting-edge renewable energy solutions.

My interests span from renewable energy systems and advanced AI (including hardware/software generative AI) to timeless subjects like history and geography‚Äîareas that continually inspire my perspective on technology and its impact on our world. In my spare time, I love 3D printing innovative designs and building fun circuits for everyday tasks‚Äîwhether it's crafting custom Bluetooth speakers or upgrading my home Roomba. These creative endeavors perfectly merge technical ingenuity with practical problem-solving, fueling both my professional and personal growth.

Feel free to connect with me on social media to share ideas, discuss projects, or simply chat about the latest innovations in energy and technology.üòä
